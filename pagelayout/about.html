				<h2>An intro</h2>
				<p id="intro">
					Originating in New York City, LCD Soundsystem first descended on the underground dance scene in 2002 with a single, Losing My Edge. The band quickly gained a following and by the time the first (self-titled, double disc) album was released in 2005, James Murphy and the gang had reached critical acclaim, earning them two Grammy nominations.
				</p>
				<p>
					Over the course of three more albums and six more years the music of LCD Soundsystem came to define a era for fans around the world who revelled in the band's commitment to making good dance music and rebellion against established orders. When the final show was announced and tickets went on sale, only for fans to be left in the cold while touts snapped them up en masse, Murphy famously declared his anger in a rant on Twitter, saying "i will try to figure a way out to fuck these fuckers. NO MATTER WHAT WE DO, IT IS NOT WORTH THAT KIND OF MONEY TO SEE US!" and "1500 for a single ticket? Fuck you, scalpers. You are parasites. I HATE you."
